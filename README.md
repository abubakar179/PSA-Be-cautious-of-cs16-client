# PSA: Be cautious of cs16-client
My criticism of "Flying With Gauss" making cs16-client closed source

"cs16client" is an unofficial android client made for Counter Strike 1.6 by FWGS and Alibek Omarov (aka a1batross). It was once FOSS, but now has become closed source due to unknown reasons. As of 6/9/2022, the repository has been removed from GitHub. If you want to find cached versions/archived versions of the repo, check https://github.com/FWGS/cs16-client on a cool website like internet archive or google cached pages.

# Why should you leave this app?
- Proprietary
- Literally deleted the repo after I asked why mouse controls weren't working (even after giving root access to enable "evdev input" which gives "full mouse and keyboard support"). check issue #338, should have a title called <i> [FWGS/cs16-client] Mouse issues with the latest version of cs16client on the googleplay store (Issue #338) </i>.
- At one point, using a mouse was banned? I mean you're not really cheating by using them, that's how you play the game.

# Closing thoughts
Potential rootkit (although then again the user does give the app root access with their own permission)? A great yet ruined app idea? Probably. While I can grant that not all software will be open source for good reasons, it's pretty clear that the developer isn't selling the app or making money off in-app purchases. God knows what happens when you use the app. We need new FOSS alternatives, perhaps even built on previous "clean" forks of cs16-client (if there are any).
